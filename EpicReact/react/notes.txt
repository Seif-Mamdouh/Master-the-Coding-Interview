One important thing to know about React is that it supports multiple platforms (for example, native and web).
 Each of these platforms has its own code necessary for interacting with that platform, and then there's shared
  code between the platforms.

With that in mind, you need two JavaScript files to write React applications for the web:

React: responsible for creating React elements (kinda like document.createElement())
ReactDOM: responsible for rendering React elements to the DOM (kinda like rootElement.append())
