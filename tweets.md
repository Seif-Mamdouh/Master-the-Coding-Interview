🧐 Side projects taught me more than my CS degree:
🧠 University: "Here's how a binary tree works"
🤖 Side Projects: "Here's how prod breaks at 3AM"
🫡 Theory = Good
🤷‍♂️ Building = Better
🚀 Both = Unstoppable

🤷‍♂️ Why I tell every junior dev to build side projects:

1️⃣ You break things without breaking prod
2️⃣ You learn 5x faster than tutorials
3️⃣ You actually finish what you start
4️⃣ Your portfolio makes noise while you sleep

🤷‍♂️ The best time to start was yesterday.
🤷‍♂️ The second best time is now.
